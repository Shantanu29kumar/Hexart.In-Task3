Stress Detection with Machine Learning. Based on live human vitals, predict the stress levels of humans.

Based on multiple attributes associated with stress, the Machine Learning model is built by looking at the stress levels of 630 individuals.
This model is based on two features that are used to select the most relevant features from the attributes given in the dataset. Then, it is used to train and test the data to get accuracy. 
The accuracy of this model is around 75%
