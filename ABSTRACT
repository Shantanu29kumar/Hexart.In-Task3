**Problem Statement**: Time Series Analysis using Python. Analyze time series data using Python, visualize, plot, and prepare time series for Machine Learning.

Stress detection and prediction involve identifying and predicting instances of stress in individuals. Machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence can be used to analyze this data and predict an individual's stress levels. 

The model was trained using a dataset of 630 individuals. This made the model predict outcomes with an accuracy of more than 75%.
The attributes in the dataset include snoring range, respiration rate, body temperature, limb movement rate, blood oxygen levels, eye movement, number of hours of sleep, heart rate, and stress levels. 

In this model, we have taken two feature selections. They are:

**SelectKBest**

SelectKBest is a feature selection method in the scikit-learn (sklearn) library in Python. It is used to select a specified number (k) of the best features from a set of features based on a specified score function. The score function used to evaluate the features can be either regression or classification-based. SelectKBest then returns the k features with the highest scores, which can be utilized as inputs for a machine learning model. This method is commonly applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set, improve the interpretability of the model, and increase the model's performance by reducing overfitting.

**SelectPercentile**

SelectPercentile is a feature selection method in the scikit-learn (sklearn) library in Python. It is similar to SelectKBest, but instead of selecting a fixed number (k) of features, it selects a specified percentage of the best features. The percentage of features to be selected is defined by the "percentile" parameter in the SelectPercentile function. The features are selected based on a specified score function, which can be either regression or classification-based. The features with the highest scores are then selected and can be used as inputs for a machine-learning model. SelectPercentile is commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set, improve the interpretability of the model, and increase the model's performance by reducing overfitting.

On our first attempt to train the data, the accuracy was around 52%. But again classifying the features and then training the data our model prediction performed around 75% which is quite a reasonable number with respect to our dataset.

Stress detection and prediction aim to help individuals manage stress more effectively and prevent adverse health outcomes associated with chronic stress.

The future scope and usability of stress detection and prediction developed with machine learning are quite promising. In the face of increasing instances of stress, it is becoming increasingly imperative to develop effective stress detection methods. As stress patterns change over time, machine learning is particularly suited for this task because it can identify patterns in large data sets quickly.
